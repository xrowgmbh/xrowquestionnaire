2. License Grant. Subject to payment and the other terms and conditions
hereof, Licensor grants to Licensee a limited, non-exclusive and
non-transferable right to: (a) install and run the Licensed Software on
a Per Website Basis; and (b) modify or make enhancements, improvements,
patches, workarounds, bug fixes ("Licensee Modifications") to the
Licensed Software, or permit a third party to do so on Licensee's

right upon no fewer than 30 days' prior notice. Licensee will provide
Licensor with reasonable accommodation for the review, including

Licensee a copy of the results of any such review. Licensee shall
promptly pay the amount of any underpayment. Licensee shall also pay

breach remains uncured 30 days after receipt of notice. In the event
that Licensee (a) fails to pay to Licensor all License Fees when due, or
(b) becomes liquidated, dissolved, bankrupt or insolvent, whether

License, and that indicates the date(s) of each Licensee Modification.

8. Disclaimer of Warranties. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS IS,"
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, AND
LICENSEE EXPRESSLY WAIVES, ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, NON-INTERFERENCE AND
ACCURACY OF INFORMATIONAL CONTENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE
OPERATION OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE,
OR THAT ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. THE ENTIRE RISK OF THE LICENSED
SOFTWARE'S QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE IS WITH LICENSEE.

9. Indemnification. Licensee hereby indemnifies and agrees to defend
Licensor against any and all damages, judgments and costs (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) related to any claim based upon: (a) use of
the Licensed Software in a manner prohibited under this License or in a
manner for which the Licensed Software was not designed; (b) changes
made by Licensee to the Licensed Software (where use of unmodified
Licensed Software would not infringe); or (c) changes made, or actions
taken, by Licensor upon Licensee's direct instructions.

10. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
LICENSOR SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER
THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION)
ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS (WHETHER RESULTING FROM IMPAIRED OR
LOST DATA, SOFTWARE OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR ANY OTHER CAUSE), EVEN IF IT
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
OTHER PROVISION IN THIS LICENSE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, THE LIABILITY OF LICENSOR FOR ANY REASON AND UPON ANY CAUSE OF
ACTION SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID TO LICENSOR BY LICENSEE UNDER
THIS LICENSE. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION IN THE
AGGREGATE, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF
WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OTHER TORTS. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT THE REMEDIES AND LIMITATIONS HEREIN ALLOCATE THE RISKS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS AUTHORIZED BY APPLICABLE LAWS. THE LICENSE FEES
ARE SET IN RELIANCE UPON THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THE EXCLUSION OF
CERTAIN DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE.

11. Miscellaneous.

11.1 Interpretation. Failure by Licensor to exercise any right or remedy
does not signify acceptance of the event giving rise to such right or
remedy. No action arising out of this License may be brought by Licensee
more than one year after the cause of action has accrued. If any part of
this License is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal
or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
this License shall not be affected and such provision shall be deemed
modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
consistent with applicable law and, in its modified form, such provision
shall be enforceable and enforced. Licensor reserves the right not to
accept any order for the Licensed Software. Any invoice issued by
Licensor in connection with this License shall be deemed a part of this
License. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Licensee's order
and an invoice issued by Licensor, the terms and conditions of the
invoice shall prevail; Licensee shall be deemed to have accepted an
invoice upon payment of such invoice.

11.2 Binding. This License will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Without the prior written consent of Licensor, Licensee shall not
assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer this License or its rights or
obligations under this License to any person or party, whether by
operation of law or otherwise; any attempt by Licensee to assign this
License without Licensor's prior written consent shall be null and void.
There are no intended third party beneficiaries of this License. The
parties are, and shall remain, independent contractors; nothing in this
License is designed to create, nor shall create between them, a
partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship.

11.3 Governing Law; Dispute Forum. This License shall be deemed to have
been executed in Norway and shall be governed by the laws of Norway,
without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. The Parties
shall first attempt to resolve any disputes, controversies, or claims (a
"Dispute") arising out of or relating to this License through
discussions and negotiations between each other. If a Dispute cannot be
resolved amicably between the Parties, such Dispute shall be referred to
Oslo City Court as mandatory venue. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, if the Licensee is located in a country that does not have a
bilateral or multilateral ruling enforcement treaty with Norway, the
Dispute shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration
administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
Arbitration and Mediation Center in accordance with the WIPO Arbitration
Rules. The place of arbitration shall be in Skien, Norway. The
arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of this License and base the
award on applicable law and judicial precedent. The Parties agree that
the arbitrator shall have the power to decide all matters, including
arbitrability, and to award any remedies, including attorneys' fees,
costs and equitable relief, available under applicable law. Either party
may enforce any judgment rendered by the arbitrator in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The Parties further agree and acknowledge that
arbitration shall be the sole, exclusive and final remedy for any
dispute between the Parties, and they are waiving their respective
rights to have any dispute between them resolved in a court of law by a
judge or jury. In no event shall the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or any adopted version of
the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act apply to, or govern,
this License. Licensee shall comply at its own expense with all relevant
and applicable laws related to use of the Licensed Software as permitted
in this License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor may seek
injunctive or other equitable relief in any jurisdiction in order to
protect its intellectual property rights. The parties have agreed to
execute this License in the English language, and the English language
version of the License will control for all purposes. Any action brought
under this License shall be conducted in the English language. Licensee
shall be responsible for Licensor's attorneys fees and other expenses
associated with the enforcement of this License or the collection of any
amounts due under this License. If the Licensee is located in Quebec,
Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that
they have requested that this Agreement be drafted in English. Les
parties contractantes confirment qu'elles ont exigé quele présent
contrat et tous les documents associés soient redigés en anglais.

11.4 Notice. Any notice under this License shall be delivered and
addressed to Licensee at the address provided to Licensor (or authorized
representative) at the time of order, and to Licensor at Attn: Software
Licensing Dept., eZ Systems AS, Klostergata 30, N-3732 Skien, Norway.

receipt verified; (b) on the third day after deposit, if mailed by

accordance with this Section.

11.5 Export Law Assurances. Licensee is responsible for complying with
any applicable local laws, including but not limited to export and
import regulations.

11.6 U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If the Licensed Software is
being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S.
Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), in
accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense ("DOD")
acquisitions) and 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions),
the government's rights in the Licensed Software and any documentation,
including its rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display or disclose the Licensed Software or any documentation, will be
subject in all respects to the commercial license rights and
restrictions provided in this License.

11.7 No Confidentiality. Licensee may disclose all terms of this License
to others.

11.8 Entire Agreement. This License (including any invoice) comprises
the entire agreement, and supercedes and merges all prior proposals,
understandings and agreements, oral and written, between the parties
relating to the subject matter of this License. This License may be
amended or modified only in a writing executed by both parties. To the
extent of any conflict or inconsistency between this License and any
invoice or other document submitted by Licensee to Licensor, this
License will control. Licensor's acceptance of any document shall not be
construed as an acceptance of provisions which are in any way in
conflict or inconsistent with, or in addition to, this License, unless
such terms are separately and specifically accepted in writing by an
authorized officer of Licensor.
